We work on a three-semester track. Our classes and students usually like at least a three-week lead on work that would start the following semester. Some opportunities can have up to a six-month waiting list.  

| Semester  | Period          |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Winter    | January - April |
| Spring    | May - July      |
| Fall      | September - December |

We work in tandem with the [Research and Business Development Center](https://www.rbdcenter.org/data-analytics/), which you can contact for details.

A statement of need document helps us interact with you. We are looking for four things.

1. A brief background of the problem
2. A set of questions that you need answering
3. data (we sign NDAs)
4. A general guide on a deliverable (dashboard, report, predictive model)
