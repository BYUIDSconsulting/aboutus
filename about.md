### It is our goal to get your business in our classrooms and students' lives.

## Integrated Data Science

Since 2017 we have built our undergraduate data science program to be industry-focused. We enjoy having our students and faculty work on the latest data problems you face.

We don't need you to clean data to collaborate (we love munging the data). But, we do need data. You can share your data or guide us to find publicly available data that needs to be aggregated and formatted.

Our students are well versed in Python, R, SQL, and dashboarding tools like Tableau, PowerBI, and Looker. We can leverage the tools of data science to tackle any aspect of the data science process.

## Coursework

You can review the full program at the [BYU-I Catalog](https://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/41PwqJ9RZ). More details on the specific data science courses can be found [here](https://byuistats.github.io/).
