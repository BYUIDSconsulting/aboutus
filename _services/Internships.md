Each data science student is required to complete an internship before graduation. You get the opportunity to test them out in your team.

## BYU-I Track System

We have students that need to complete internships in the Fall, Winter, and Summer. You can leverage multiple interns as low-cost FTE through our program. We provide recruiting opportunities each semester.
