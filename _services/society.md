Our data science society is a student association that tackles business problems at little to no monetary cost.  Student teams of 3-6 partner on your business-driven project to deliver your more minor data science needs.

## Details

- __Hours:__ The student teams put in 4-8 hours a week and meet on Wednesdays at 6 pm Mountain as project teams.  The projects last 10-11 weeks.
- __Skill Level:__ Many of the students are in their second or third year of the program.  They have experience with Python and R.  
- __Project Examples:__ Clients have us build [Shiny](), [Streamlit](), or [PowerBI]() dashboards. We also tackle data automation requests (web scraping, API use, data munging).

## Expectations

Many of these projects are proof-of-concept projects.  Upperclass data science students are project managers and technical experts.  A faculty mentor oversees the student leadership team that supports the project managers.
